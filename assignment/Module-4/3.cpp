//What is the difference between OOP and POP? 
//The key differences between Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP)
// lie in their approach to program design, data management, and structure.


//POP:  It focuses on the steps involved in solving a problem and follows a top-down approach.
// Data is often treated as separate from the procedures that operate on it.

//OOP : models real-world entities as objects, which have both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
//It focuses on the relationships between objects and how they interact with each other. 
//OOP promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability through concepts like 
//inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.A
